I wanted a version of Google's diff-match-patch library that could be easily installed with NPM for use in Node / JS projects. To that end, I made these changes:

1. I forked their library and deleted all of the non-JS stuff.
2. I modified the way values were exported from the main JS file (`diff_match_patch.js`).
3. I added `eslint`, `prettier`, and `esbuild` to help with linting, formatting, and bundling.
4. I updated the `.gitignore` file to ignore only JS-specific items.
5. I added some spacing between lines and comments that were (in my opinion) a little too cramped.
6. I converted all `var` declarations to `let` or `const`.
7. I modified the tests to run from the command line rather than from within a browser.
8. I renamed the constructor to `DiffMatchPatch`, which seems more conventional for class names in JS than `diff_match_patch`. Eventually, I'd like to rewrite some of it using conventional class notation.
9. I pared the `README.md` down to just JS-specific stuff.
10. I renamed the "master" branch to "main".
